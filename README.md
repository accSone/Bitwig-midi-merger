Bitwig Controller Scripts to merge MIDI inputs

This script is provided by accSone - the vendor of the granular synthesis plug-in crusher-X (http://www.accsone.com). 
It's a simple but powerful MIDI input script that merges MIDI keyboard inputs. 
It can be used to merge the MIDI output of your keyboards or controllers and use it for e.g. a track input. 

Just add it manually to the controller list and set up the inputs of your MIDI interface or your USB MIDI Keyboard.
Makes sure you select all slots, otherwise the script will not be enabled.
Select the controller "MIDI Merger - accSone" as a track input in the Bitwig inspector.
